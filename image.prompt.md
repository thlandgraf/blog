# Step 1: think about 5 scenes which illustrate that blog post best for the reader.
# Step 2: Ask me, which of the scenes to choose
# Step 3: Create the Image

Create a 16:9 digital illustration in a refined, blueprint-meets-steampunk style that visually 
defines a futuristic but vintage-inspired tech aesthetic. The illustration should resemble a 
technical schematic on a textured blueprint paper, evoking craftsmanship and intelligence.

The image should visually represent the synergy between classical engineering and generative AI (vibe coding), forming a consistent visual signature that feels like an iconic blog brand.‚Äù**
* no frame at the border, instead put empty margins around the scene
* the image content shall be centered
