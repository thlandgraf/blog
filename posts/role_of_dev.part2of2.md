## Part 2: The AI-Enabled Full Stack Developer

To enable AI to solve software development tasks, it requires two crucial components: **Guidance** and **Feedback**.

### The Solo Developer: A Shift in Dynamics

Being a one-man show, delegating tasks entirely to AI, is a lot different from being part of a traditional 5-person team where each member focuses on a specific part of the problem. Let's start by exploring the **upside** of this shift.

### The Upside

When you work solo with AI, you no longer need a scrum master to manage the process or teammates to collaborate with. All that’s necessary is your understanding of the problem and direct communication with your customers. The AI takes care of the execution. If you’re introverted, you can handle everything via email—no product manager needed to mediate between you and the client.

You can even handle all project negotiation in your own time, perhaps during a shower in the morning—no more daily stand-up meetings! 

Testing? That’s also taken care of. The AI can automatically generate unit tests, so there’s no need for a dedicated tester.

This setup provides a **2x efficiency boost** on top of the **10x increase** that AI gives you in the development process. But will it feel lonely? No. With this 20x productivity, equivalent to the output of a 5-person team, you can now spend 75% of your time communicating directly with customers and stakeholders, building relationships, and understanding their needs.

### New Skills to Learn

Now, let’s discuss what you need to learn to truly excel in this AI-driven environment. 

#### What NOT to Focus On
Do not spend time trying to become an even better expert in your specialized field. As outlined in the first part of this post, your deep specialization is becoming less valuable as AI takes over these tasks. The key now is not about becoming a more focused expert; it's about becoming a better generalist.

#### Guiding the AI
Your primary skill set should now focus on **guiding the AI**. You need to provide it with the context of the project, outline the constraints, and break down the project into manageable packages. The AI works best when fed digestible tasks, so your role is to structure the project in a way that the AI can easily understand and execute.

#### Feedback Mechanisms
The AI won't always get things right. When failures occur, it's essential to systematically explain the issues to the AI, allowing it to iterate and improve. Understanding principles like **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** is crucial because these methodologies provide feedback mechanisms not just for you, but for the AI as well. They help ensure that both you and the AI are aligned in understanding the expected behavior of the software.

### Knowing the Foundations

To effectively guide and collaborate with AI, you must be familiar with the best practices and purposes of the foundational technologies you're requesting. For example, if you ask the AI to change the color of a button in Terraform, the AI will (hopefully) tell you that this is a task for CSS, not Terraform. You need a basic grasp of these core technologies to avoid mistakes and ensure the AI is working in the right areas. 

A full-stack developer of the 2010s knows this instinctively. Now, with AI in the mix, it's even more critical to have this foundational knowledge.

### Debugging the AI

Sounds good, right? But from my experience, there’s a catch: you’ll spend time debugging AI-generated code. The role of a “detective” will become a part of your daily routine as you help the AI understand what went wrong. The hope is that over time, the AI will become smarter, and as you get better at providing structured feedback, this aspect of your role will decrease. Until then, expect to play a significant role in guiding and debugging AI-generated solutions.

With these insights, you’re better equipped to transition into the role of an AI-enabled full stack developer. The skills needed may seem daunting at first, but they offer a new, more efficient way of working, allowing you to focus on problem-solving and strategy rather than repetitive tasks. In this future, your expertise lies in guiding the AI to solve complex problems, not in specializing in one narrow area of technology.
