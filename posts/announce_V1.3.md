# Node Search Capabilities
As our users' concept maps become increasingly intricate, the ability to swiftly locate specific nodes has become essential. 
Responding to popular demand, we've introduced robust search functionalities to streamline your navigation through complex maps.

## Intuitive UI Search
A new search button now resides in the upper right corner of the Conceptmap interface. Clicking this button reveals a search bar, inviting you to enter your 
query. Initially, the search function combs through your recent map interactions, providing immediate results. For a more comprehensive search, you can 
extend the query to the backend, allowing you to scour your entire concept map for the desired keywords.

## Chat-Powered Search
Within the ChatGPT chat environment, you can initiate a search simply by typing: "search for <YOUR_SEARCH_TERM>". The plugin will then present the 
relevant findings directly in the chat. This search is confined to the concepts active in your current session, ensuring relevance and focus.
Retrieving these results refreshes the chat with pertinent information, allowing GPT-4 to concentrate on the content that matters most to your ongoing work. 
Conceptmap thus evolves into a persistent, cross-session memory aid for your concepts, akin to a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, enhancing your conceptual continuity.

## Quality of Life Enhancements
To streamline your workflow, we've integrated direct URLs into the map's structure. Now, by using the command "read in the structure of node [ID_OF_YOUR_ROOTNODE]", 
the concept map's architecture is displayed along with clickable links to each node, making navigation and review more efficient.

## Community Tips & Shortcuts
- Discover a quick way to visualize your concept map within the chat by using the command "draw the structure as ascii art". This feature transforms your map into an ASCII art representation, providing a clear and immediate overview.
- When you need guidance on where to focus next, the command "read in the structure of node [ID_OF_YOUR_ROOTNODE] and suggest where to work on [YOUR_TARGET_GOAL]" becomes invaluable. It not only displays the current structure but also recommends the most relevant node to advance your project towards your specified objective.

We'd like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the Conceptmap community for your invaluable feedback and suggestions. Your insights drive the continuous improvement of this tool, 
and we encourage you to keep sharing your experiences and ideas with us. Together, we can make Conceptmap an even more powerful aid in your creative and organizational endeavors.

Wishing you all a delightful and productive mapping experience with Conceptmap. Happy mapping!
