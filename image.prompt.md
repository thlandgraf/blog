“Create a 16:9 digital illustration in a refined, blueprint-meets-steampunk style that visually defines a futuristic but vintage-inspired tech aesthetic. The illustration should resemble a technical schematic on a textured blueprint paper, evoking craftsmanship and intelligence.

Base the layout on a horizontal engineering draft board with the following artistic cues:
	•	Background: Deep blueprint grid (#2A2E38) with light paper aging at the edges
	•	Mechanical Motifs: Vintage drafting tools, gears, cogs, pipes, pistons, levers — subtly integrated and functionally positioned
	•	Modern Tech Fusion: Include sleek UI elements like tablets, terminal screens, neural nets, or LLM blocks, blended into the machinery
	•	Highlight Effects: Use glowing turquoise neon (#3EF5E0) to indicate AI activity or data flow; glow should subtly contrast with brass and copper
	•	Metallic Accents: Brass (#C4953E) and Copper (#A64D3B) to detail mechanical parts, valves, and icons
	•	Typography: Prominently include the blog post title in a classic serif font (e.g., Cinzel, Garamond) using warm ivory white (#EAE0C8); position like a blueprint label
	•	Annotations: Use technical diagram callouts in calligraphic or drafting-style script (#EAE0C8), pointing to components or flows (e.g., “Prompt”, “LLM”, “Generated Code”)
	•	Stylistic Effects: Add soft shadows, etched line effects, faint smudges, and drafting marks for realism
	•	Composition: Balanced and clear — left-heavy compositions (e.g., machine input) flowing to right (e.g., screen/output) work well

The image should visually represent the synergy between classical engineering and generative AI (vibe coding), forming a consistent visual signature that feels like an iconic blog brand.”**
