**"Create a digital illustration in a modern, vintage-inspired style. The design should combine steampunk aesthetics with futuristic elements, styled like a refined technical blueprint. Use a dark blue-gray backdrop as the base color, with brass and copper accents for metallic details. Highlight important elements with glowing turquoise neon accents, creating a sense of advanced technology. Maintain precise drafting tool marks, clear annotations in elegant, calligraphic script, and intricate mechanical details. The composition should feature a blend of historical mechanical motifs (like gears, levers, and dials) alongside sleek digital interfaces, such as tablets or holographic screens. Use soft shadows, subtle gradients, and a clean, balanced layout.

The overall color scheme should include:

Background: Dark blue-gray (#2A2E38).

Primary Accents: Brass (#C4953E) and Copper (#A64D3B).

Highlight Accents: Glowing Turquoise Neon (#3EF5E0).

Text and Annotations: Warm ivory white (#EAE0C8) in calligraphic style.

The title of the blog post must be prominently included in a stylish, serif font (such as 'Cinzel' or 'Garamond'), using warm ivory white (#EAE0C8). Ensure the image has a 16:9 aspect ratio."**
