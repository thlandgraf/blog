# **Farewell to Conceptmap and Astro-Insights: A Heartfelt Goodbye**

Hello dear community,

It is with a mix of gratitude and reflection that I announce the discontinuation of two projects that have been very close to my heart: **Conceptmap** and **Astro-Insights**. These ChatGPT plugins were designed to push the boundaries of conceptual work and AstroDynamics, and they thrived thanks to the support, feedback, and enthusiasm of each one of you.

## **A Journey of Innovation**

Both plugins were born out of a desire to make significant strides in their respective fields. Conceptmap aimed to revolutionize conceptual work by integrating seamless workflows with ChatGPT, while Astro-Insights set out to become the quintessential assistant for experts in AstroDynamics, with capabilities ranging from mission simulations to data analysis.

Though the projects have reached an endpoint, the journey has been an extraordinary one. I have learned so much throughout this process, from the practical aspects of plugin development to the insights gained from user feedback.

## **Why Discontinue?**

Unfortunately, with OpenAI's recent decision to discontinue support for ChatGPT Plugins, the continued development and maintenance of these projects have become untenable. It was a difficult decision, but after careful consideration, Iâ€™ve chosen to gracefully bring both Conceptmap and Astro-Insights to a close.

## **A Heartfelt Thank You**

To everyone who installed, tested, and provided feedback on Conceptmap and Astro-Insights: thank you. Your support was instrumental in shaping these tools, and the insights I gained from your experiences were invaluable. While these plugins will no longer be available, their legacy lives on in the lessons learned and the innovations sparked along the way.

## **Looking Forward**

This is not the end of innovation but rather the closing of a chapter that will fuel the next stage of creativity and development. I look forward to new challenges and opportunities and will continue to explore ways to leverage AI and technology for practical, real-world applications.

Thank you for being part of this journey. I remain deeply grateful for the support and inspiration I received.

Stay curious and innovative!

**With Gratitude, Thomas**
