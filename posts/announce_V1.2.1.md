# Conceptmap ChatGPT Plugin V1.2.1 Update (LMPT4U)

We're pleased to announce the release of Conceptmap ChatGPT Plugin V1.2.1 This update brings the LMPT4U feature and some bug-fixes.

## Introducing the "Let Me Prompt That for You" Feature in Conceptmap's Prompt-Wizard

In the early days of the internet, many turned to forums and newsgroups to seek answers, often bypassing the simplicity of a Google search. To address this, "Let Me Google That for You" was born, a playful tool that animated the process of googling a question, nudging users to try searching first.

Fast forward to today, with the rise of LLM and ChatGPT, we find ourselves in a reminiscent scenario. Many are still navigating the best ways to interact with these advanced AI models, and sometimes, a little guidance can go a long way. 

To assist, we've added a new feature to the Conceptmap [Prompt-Wizard](https://app.concept-map.com/prompt-wizard) : "Let Me Prompt That for You." Here's how it works:

1. Craft your desired prompt within the Prompt-Wizard.
2. Generate a shortened link directly from the wizard.
3. Share this link with anyone seeking guidance.

When they click on the link, they'll be greeted by the Prompt-Wizard, which will animate the process of crafting the prompt, showcasing the best way to interact with ChatGPT.

It's a fun, educational tool designed to help users harness the full potential of ChatGPT, with a nod to the playful spirit of the early internet. Try it out and enhance your ChatGPT interactions!
